# Summer-2018
Various projects done for or inspired by Mr. Coleman's Tritech summer course.

Mad Lib: Simple Python assignment that creates a mad lib based off user input.
Minecraft Guard Tower: Assignment was to create a simple minecraft object using python. I went a little bigger than the assignment called for.
Easy Morse Code: The class was given some simple assignments to complete using Arduinos. I don't know what these were because I was too busy doing this.
